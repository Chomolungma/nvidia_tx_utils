# Torch7 on Jetson TX1 for Stereo Matching

## Installing Torch7 on NVIDIA TX1

To install Torch7 on the Jetson TX1, I recommend using [dusty-nv](https://github.com/dusty-nv)'s installation script.<br/>

Click [here](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-reinforcement) to go to the Torch7 installation repository. Follow the instructions and you should have Torch7 successfully running on the TX1 in under 45 minutes. You can skip the gazebo install and that should make the process quicker.

The actual installation script can be found [here](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-reinforcement/blob/master/CMakePreBuild.sh).

The above script did not automatically update my bash profile, so don't forget to do that if it hasn't done it for you automatically.

Adding the following to your $PATH variable should work:

> /home/ubuntu/jetson-reinforcement/build/torch/bin

The above installation script does not install the 'cunn' library, therefore you'll have to install that manually using luarocks

>git clone https://github.com/torch/cunn

>cd cunn

>luarocks make rocks/cunn-scm-1.rockspec
